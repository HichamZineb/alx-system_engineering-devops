# Postmortem: MySQL Database Outage

## Issue Summary

- **Duration**: November 10, 2023, 8:00 PM - November 11, 2023, 2:00 AM (UTC)
  
- **Impact**: The MySQL database experienced an outage, affecting user authentication. Approximately 20% of users were unable to log in during the outage.

- **Root Cause**: The database server ran out of disk space due to an unexpected increase in log file sizes.

## Timeline

- **Issue Detection (November 10, 2023, 8:00 PM)**: Users reported login failures, and monitoring indicated a sudden increase in database response times.

- **Actions Taken (November 10, 2023, 8:30 PM)**: The DevOps team initiated an investigation, focusing on the database server. Assumed root cause to be a potential database query optimization issue.

- **Misleading Paths (November 10, 2023, 9:00 PM)**: Initial investigation erroneously focused on query optimization, delaying the identification of the disk space issue.

- **Escalation (November 10, 2023, 9:30 PM)**: The incident was escalated to senior DevOps members as the database issue persisted.

- **Resolution (November 11, 2023, 2:00 AM)**: By this time, the root cause was identified as insufficient disk space. Temporary files were cleared, and log rotation settings were adjusted to prevent future occurrences.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause Explanation**: The database server ran out of disk space due to an unexpected surge in log file sizes, causing essential database operations to fail.

- **Resolution Explanation**: Temporary files were cleared to free up disk space, and log rotation settings were adjusted to prevent log files from growing excessively.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes**: 
  - Implement proactive monitoring for disk space usage on critical servers.
  - Review and optimize log rotation settings.

- **Specific Tasks**: 
  - Conduct a database server capacity review.
  - Implement automated alerts for abnormal increases in log file sizes.
  - Document and share learnings with the team to improve incident response.
